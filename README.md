=== Hydrodynamical Physics via Deep Generative Painting ===

HyPhy is a a conditional deep generative model, implemented in tensorflow, for mapping from dark matter only simulations to full hydrodynamical physics models. This repository includes a basic example of the model, as well as sample data files. Users who are interested in imbedding HyPhy into their applications or extend the existing framework should contact Ben Horowitz at bhorowitz@princeton.edu for more information.
